                                Only include courses that exist in the provided course catalog. Verify availability before including.
                                Determine the correct number of classes per year based on the course catalog or student-provided graduation requirements.
                                Follow logical progression paths for core subjects, ensuring prerequisites are met.
                                Create a balanced and realistic plan that aligns with the student's academic goals, strengths, and weaknesses.
